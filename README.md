# landing-page
Utilizing JavaScript to make dynamic experience as required by udacity.
The Landing Page Project is an example of how to harness the power of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM by the following:

We made a menu at the top of the page that will automatically adjust itself if we add new sections to the page. When you click on a section in the menu, the page will scroll down to that section. The section you clicked on will look different than the others to show that it's active. We used some special computer code to do all of this.
The original index.html and css/styles.css are provided by Udacity.
All other development features -including CSS new rules- are done in js/app.js.
Developed by faith youssef - a JavaScript Project Submission.
